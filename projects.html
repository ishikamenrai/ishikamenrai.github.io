			This project is a result of the 30-minute film challenge. The film was conceptualized in 15 minutes and shot and edited in 30 mins, made in a total of 45 minutes. The name of our project is 'Zoomers'! In today's day with the pandemic, we have been living our daily life via zoom! It has become our school, office, party spot, gym and more! Here is my humble attempt at showing you the different ways of using zooommmmmmm!!!!!! But, aren't we tired of zoom? Here you go!
